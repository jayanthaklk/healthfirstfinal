                <blockquote>
                  <p>Regardless of your version of true happiness, living a happier, more satisfied life is within
                    reach. A few tweaks to your regular habits like getting more sleep and exercise can help you get
                    there.

                  </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Habits matter. If you’ve ever tried breaking a bad habit, you know all too well how engrained they
                  are.

                  Well, good habits are deeply engrained, too. Why not work on making positive habits part of your
                  routine?

                  Here’s a look at some daily, monthly, and yearly habits to help kickstart your quest. Just remember
                  that everyone’s version of happiness is a little different, and so is their path to achieving it.

                  If some of these habits create added stress or just don’t fit your lifestyle, ditch them. With a
                  little time and practice, you’ll figure out what does and doesn’t work for you. </p>

                <h2>Daily habits
                </h2>
                <h3>1. Smile
                </h3>
                <p>
                  You tend to smile when you’re happy. But it’s actually a two-way street.

                  We smile because we’re happy, and smiling causes the brain to release dopamine, which makes us
                  happier.

                  While not completely foolproof, researchers have found that the link between smiling and happiness
                  could be attributed to the “facial feedback hypothesis,” where facial expressions may have a modest
                  influence on emotions.

                  That does not mean you have to go around with a fake smile plastered on your face all the time. But
                  the next time you find yourself feeling low, crack a smile and see what happens. Or try starting each
                  morning by smiling at yourself in the mirror. </p>

                <h3>2. Exercise
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Exercise isn’t just for your body. Regular exercise can help reduce stress, feelings of anxiety, and
                  symptoms of depression while boosting self-esteem and happiness.

                  Even a small amount of physical activity can make a difference. You don’t have to train for a
                  triathlon or scale a cliff — unless that’s what makes you happy, of course.

                  The trick is to not overexert yourself. If you suddenly throw yourself into a strenuous routine, you
                  may just end up frustrated (and sore).

                  Consider these exercise starters: </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Take a walk around the block every night after dinner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sign up for a beginner’s class in yoga or tai chi.

                  </li>
                  Start your day with 5 minutes of stretching.
                  <li>
                    Start your day with 5 minutes of stretching.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Get plenty of sleep
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Most adults need at least 7 hoursTrusted Source of sleep every night. If you find yourself fighting
                  the urge to nap during the day or just generally feel like you’re in a fog, your body may be telling
                  you it needs more rest.

                  No matter how much our modern society steers us toward less sleep, we know that adequate sleep is
                  vitalTrusted Source to good health, brain function, and emotional well-being. Getting enough sleep
                  also reduces your riskTrusted Source of developing certain chronic illnesses, such as heart disease,
                  depression, and diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are a few tips to help you build a better sleep routine:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Write down how many hours of sleep you get each night and how rested you feel. After a week, you
                    should have a better idea how you’re doing. You can also try using an app to track your sleep.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including on weekends.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reserve the hour before bed as quiet time. Take a bath, read, or do something relaxing. Avoid heavy
                    eating and drinking.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Invest in some good bedding.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you have to take a nap, try limiting it to 20 minutes.

                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  If you consistently have problems sleeping, consider talking with a doctor. You may have a sleep
                  disorder that requires treatment.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Eat with mood in mind

                </h3>
                <p>
                  You may already know that your food choices have an impact on your overall physical health. But some
                  foods can also affect your state of mind.
                </p>

                <figure class="figure mb-4"><img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
                    src="./assets/img/health blog/raw food diat.jpg" alt="..." />
                  <figcaption class="figure-caption fst-italic">Raw Food</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  For example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Carbohydrates release serotonin, a “feel good” hormone. Just keep simple carbs — foods high in sugar
                    and starch — to a minimum because that energy surge is short and you’ll crash. Choosing complex
                    carbs, such as vegetables, beans, and whole grains, can help you avoid a crash while still providing
                    serotonin.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lean meat, poultry, legumes, and dairy are high in protein. Protein-rich foods release dopamine and
                    norepinephrine, which boost energy and concentration.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fatty fish, have been found to have anti-inflammatory
                    effectsTrusted Source that extend to your overall brain health. If you don’t eat fish, you might
                    consider talking with a doctor about possible supplementation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Highly processed or deep-fried foods tend to leave you feeling down and so will skipping meals.

                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  If you want to eat with your mood in mind, consider starting with making one food choice for your mood
                  each day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, swap a big, sweet breakfast pastry for some Greek yogurt with fruit. You’ll still satisfy
                  your sweet tooth, and the protein will help you avoid a midmorning energy crash. Consider adding in a
                  new food swap each week.

                </p>

                <h3>5. Practice gratitude
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Simply being grateful can give your mood a big boost, among other benefits. For example, a two-part
                  study found that practicing gratitude can have a significant impact on feelings of hope and happiness.
                </p>
                <p>You might try starting each day by acknowledging one thing you’re grateful for. You can do this while
                  you’re brushing your teeth or just waiting for that snoozed alarm to go off.

                </p>
                <p>
                  As you go about your day, consider keeping an eye out for pleasant things in your life. They can be
                  big things, such as knowing that someone loves you or getting a well-deserved promotion.

                </p>
                <p>
                  But they can also be little things, such as a co-worker who offered you a cup of coffee or the
                  neighbor who waved to you. Maybe it could even just be the warmth of the sun on your skin.

                  With a little practice, you may even become more aware of all the positive things around you.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Give a compliment
                </h3>
                <p>Research shows that performing acts of kindness may also help promote your overall well-being.

                  Giving a sincere compliment is a quick, easy way to brighten someone’s day while giving your own
                  happiness a boost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Catch the person’s eye and say it with a smile so they know you mean it. You might be surprised by how
                  good it makes you feel.

                  If you want to offer someone a compliment on their physical appearance, make sure to do it in a
                  respectful way.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Breathe deeply
                </h3>
                <p>
                  You’re tense, your shoulders are tight, and you feel as though you just might “lose it.” We all know
                  that feeling.


                </p>
                <p>Instinct may tell you to take a long, deep breath to calm yourself down.

                  Turns out, that instinct is a good one. ResearchTrusted Source supports the fact that slow breathing
                  and deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The next time you feel stressed or are at your wit’s end, work through these steps:

                  life.

                  If you get some bad news, make a mistake, or just feel like you’re in a funk, don’t try to pretend
                  you’re happy.

                <p>
                  Acknowledge the feeling of unhappiness, letting yourself experience it for a moment. Then shift your
                  focus toward what made you feel this way and what it might take to recover.

                  It can be as simple as jotting down a few thoughts before you go to bed. If putting certain things in

                  Instead of letting yourself get overwhelmed, try to address the stressor head-on. This might mean
                  initiating an uncomfortable conversation or putting in some extra work, but the sooner you confront

                  We’re certainly happier when we learn how to cope with obstacles. When you’re faced with a problem,

                  While the start of a new year is a good time to stop and take inventory of your life, you can set up

                  25. Plan a trip
                </h3>
                <p>
                  With an ever-hectic schedule, sometimes it’s easy to forget to schedule something else that’s crucial
                  to your well-being: time off. You can reap even more benefits by planning a trip, whether it’s close
                  to home or somewhere further away.

                </p>
                <p>
                  What’s more, research also backs both the mental and physical benefits of taking that much-needed
                  vacation. In one such study, researchers looked at stress and heart rate as it relates to taking a
                  vacation. They found that not only did the vacation itself reduce stress, but the weeks leading up to
                  that planned trip had similar effects.
